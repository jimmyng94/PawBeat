REQUIRES: Fir1 - Bernd Porr https://github.com/berndporr/fir1, ADS1015, LSM6DS3

What's needed: 

- Add code for sending bpm & step down pipe (not sure if these variables even send from the right place...)              
              
- Not sure of best threshold for bpm conversion with 50 sps - would need new samples in Excel to examine
               
- Not sure of threshold for step - I just made something up. Any way there is some data I could look at?
               
- Not sure which pin ACC interrupts from. Needed for #define statement
               
I have no idea if any of this will work
