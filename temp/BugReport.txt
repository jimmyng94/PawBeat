ProcessingTest.cpp

- getBPM() NEEDS FIX
val variable has constant value of 4095
newVal changes (roughly between 1 and -1) but is always less than 10
if loop that calculates bpm and runs the _bpm.push_back(bpm); is skipped
function returns newVal
issue seems to be that float val = ads.getLastConversionResults(); returns constant value of 4095

- writeBPM() WORKS

- sendData() WORKS

- interrupt NOT TESTED

- main() HALF-WORKS
sends newVal to website rather than bpm value
